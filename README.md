## Assembly

1. Cut out each pattern according to the [Patterns section](#patterns). If printing on large format, use [nn-slinger-largeformat.pdf](nn-slinger-largeformat.pdf). If printing on 8.5x11" use [nn-slinger-homeprint.pdf](nn-slinger-homeprint.pdf) (print in Adobe Acrobat on "Poster" mode, with "Cut Marks" turned off).

2. Using patterns **E**, 2x**F**, and **D**, create **Front Face**. Split **C4** in half to make 2x **Zippers**, and follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjf7XQ08I-c) for first attaching the two **F** patterns to the sides of one of the **Zippers** (remember to insert both **H1** before sewing the second, and adding **H3**), then sewing **E**/**D** to the top and bottom. Trim off from edges from completed **Front Face** so that it matches the dimensions of pattern **B**.

3. Repeat #2 for Patterns 2x**E** and 2x**F** for the **Top Face**. Trim off extra material from **F** patterns to make **Top Face** a rectangle.

4. Align **Front Face** right side out with one of the pattern **B** of fabric **F3**. Baste stitch inside first 1/4" seam allowance, making **Front Face** pocket.

5. Align remaining pattern **B**s (one of fabric **F1** and one of **F3**)  right side out, and baste stitch 1/4" except on the bottom long edge (we will be inserting the foam here later) to make **Back Face**.

6. Align **Top Face** short edge to short edge of **A**, right side out. Sew 1/4" seam as show on pattern. Align **Back Face** on one of the long edges of **A**, right side out (the **F1** side of the **Back Face** is the right side). Sew 1/4" seam as show on pattern. Align **Front Face** on one of the long edges of **A**, right side out (the **F1** side of the **Front Face** is the right side). The zipper should be closer to the short side of **A**. Sew 1/4" seam as show on pattern.

7. Flip **Top Face**, **Back Face**, and **Top Face** so they are wrong side out with the **A** pattern. Sew remaining 3/8" seam for each to complete French Seam.

8. Repeat #6 and #7 for other **A** pattern on other short sides of the **Top Face**, **Back Face**, and **Top Face**.

9. Align, right side out, the long edges between the **Top Face** and **Back Face** and sew 1/4" seam as show on pattern. Flip wrong side out, and sew remaining 3/8" seam to complete French Seam.

10. Repeat #9 for long edges between **Top Face** and **Front Face**.

11. Insert pattern **G** in to **Back Face**. Repeat #9 for long edge between **Front Face** and **Back Face**.

12. Loop 1.5" of **C2** through each **H3** to make 2x **Compressors**. Rip up 3/8" seam stitches between **Front Face** and both **A** patterns, centered on the center of the **F** patterns. Feed ~1/4" of **C2** from each **Compressor** through opening made by seam removal. Re-stitch 3/8" seam, and bar tack within 3/8" seam allowance, for both **Compressors**.

13. Make 2x 25" lengths of webbing from **C1** to make 2x **Straps**.  Rip up 3/8" seam stitches between **Back Face** and both **A** patterns, mirroring **Compressor** location on other **A** pattern long edge. Feed ~1/4" of **C1** from each **Strap** through opening made by seam removal. Re-stitch 3/8" seam, and bar tack within 3/8" seam allowance, for both **Straps**.

14. Feed **Straps** through opening in their corresponding **Compressor**, and feed through corresponding sides of **H3**.

15. Split **C3** in half to make 2x **Keepers**. Fold each **Keeper** in half, and stitch to create loop. Stretch loops over each **Strap** to hold down the extra webbing.
